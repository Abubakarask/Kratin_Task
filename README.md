# Kratin_Task

Created a website to help older age people in exercises that are essential for their health and fitness. The exercises are catergoised by days in a a week i.e. different
days there will be different exercises. There's also a page that will give details regarding the particular days' exercise. I've also added SOS message feature which
will text a WhatsApp message to the given/input number.
